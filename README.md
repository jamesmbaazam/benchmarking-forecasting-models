## Abstract

Real-time estimation of the time-varying reproduction number ($R_t$) and short-term case forecasting are critical for informing public health responses during infectious disease outbreaks. However, sophisticated semi-mechanistic Bayesian models often present a trade-off between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. 

We evaluated the performance of four model configurations within the `{EpiNow2}` R package: the default non-stationary prior, a non-mechanistic model, a 7-day random walk, and a stationary prior ("non-residual"). Using simulated epidemic data capturing growth, peak, and decline phases, we benchmarked these models based on runtime and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) for both $R_t$ nowcasting and 7-day infection forecasting. 

Our analysis reveals significant trade-offs between speed and performance. The non-mechanistic approach was the fastest and achieved the lowest CRPS for $R_t$ estimation but performed poorly for infection forecasting. The stationary prior model demonstrated the most consistent accuracy across epidemic phases but required the longest runtimes. The 7-day random walk model offered a balanced compromise, delivering competitive infection forecasts with moderate computational demands. 

No single model configuration outperforms others across all metrics. We recommend that users select model specifications based on their primary objective—prioritizing non-mechanistic approaches for rapid $R_t$ estimation and random-walk or stationary priors when accurate case forecasting is paramount.

## Prerequisites

<!-- List the main software requirements -->

- R 4.5.1 (see `.Rversion`)
- Quarto (latest version)
- LaTeX distribution (TeXLive or MacTeX)

**For detailed installation instructions, see [`TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md`](TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md).**

## Reproducing the Analysis

<!-- Update these steps to match your actual analysis workflow -->

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
Rscript -e "install.packages('renv'); renv::restore()"
```

Alternatively, if using Make:
```bash
make install  # If you've uncommented this target in Makefile
```

### 2. Run Analysis Scripts

<!-- Update script names and order to match your workflow -->

```bash
Rscript scripts/R/01_data_cleaning.R
Rscript scripts/R/02_exploratory_analysis.R
Rscript scripts/R/03_main_analysis.R
```

Alternatively, if using Make:
```bash
make analyze  # If you've uncommented this target in Makefile
```

### 3. Generate the Paper

```bash
quarto render paper/index.qmd
```

Alternatively, if using Make:
```bash
make render  # If you've uncommented this target in Makefile
```

The rendered PDF will be available at `paper/index.pdf`.

### Automated Builds

The GitHub Actions render workflow automatically generates the paper on every push to `main`. The latest rendered PDF is stored in `paper/index.pdf`.

## Key Figures

<!-- Update this table with your actual figures -->

| Figure | Script | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
